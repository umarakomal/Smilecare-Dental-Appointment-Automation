* Receive appointment requests (web form, webhook, or messaging).
* Check doctor availability (Google Calendar / other calendar provider).
* Create or update calendar events.
* Notify doctors and patients of appointment details.
* Send reminders and follow-ups (optional enhancements). ([n8n][2])

## 3. **Workflow Steps**

### Step 1 — Receive Appointment Request

* Trigger: HTTP Webhook or Form Input.
* Validate patient information.
* Example payload:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "[email protected]",
    "phone": "+123456789",
    "date": "2025-12-20",
    "time": "14:00",
    "service": "Dental Checkup"
  }
  ```

### Step 2 — Check Availability

* Use **Google Calendar** node to list available slots.
* If slot is free → proceed.
* If not free → respond with alternatives.

### Step 3 — Book Appointment

* Create a new event in the calendar:

  * Title: `"Dental Appointment — John Doe"`
  * Date/Time
  * Description: includes patient details & appointment ID.
* Save the returned **event ID** for future updates/cancellations. ([n8n][2])

### Step 4 — Notifications

* **Doctor Notification**

  * Email/SMS with appointment details.
  * Example:

    ```
    New Appointment Booked  
    Patient: John Doe  
    Time: Dec 20, 2:00 PM  
    ID: APT-12345
    ```
